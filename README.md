# Welcome to my Portfolio repo!

This was made using [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

Created with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/jweDCVYATCHhGLbF2a0OZT/Ross's-Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1) before starting development.


My goal with this portfolio was to acheive a solid base on which I can continue to improve over time.
